# Version 2.0.0

- üö® (BREAKING) üö® We upgraded the version of Rust used to build Volta, which drops support for older versions of glibc & Linux kernel. See [the Rust announcement from August 2022](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/08/01/Increasing-glibc-kernel-requirements.html) for details about the supported versions. Notably, this means that we no longer support CentOS 6 (#1611)
