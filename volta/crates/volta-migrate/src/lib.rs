//! Provides types for modeling the current state of the Volta directory and for migrating between versions
//!
//! A new layout should be represented by its own struct (as in the existing v0 or v1 modules)
//! Migrations between types should be represented by `TryFrom` implementations between the layout types
//! (see v1.rs for examples)
//!
//! NOTE: Since the layout file is written once the migration is complete, all migration implementations
//! need to be aware that they may be partially applied (if something fails in the process) and should be
//! able to re-start gracefully from an interrupted migration
